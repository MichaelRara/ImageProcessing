# Image processing project - Master thesis project

This is my master thesis project! The goal was to create a software to decrease geometric deformations in a set of images of the Moon. Those deformations are caused by the atmosphere. I created the software from a scratch.

# Used methods
Arithmetic mean to denoise images, gradient method to detect edges, correlation of images, linear interpolation over plane and line, 2D discrete convolution, RGB color space.

# Input and results of my software
